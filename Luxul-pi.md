The Luxul Photon Indicator is a small command driven LED. It is ideal for physical interfaces and giving notification to users. It is capable of displaying 16 different colors. Commands are given through a KaiComm SSI compatible port.

Commands
----
 - **0x0000**: Query Device Info: Sends Vendor Code, Device ID, Device Type, and Version over SSI.
 - **0x0001**: Get status: Sends current color status in the standard pi word format. -Shown below-
 - **0x0002**: Set status: Sets color status in the standard pi word format. -Shown below-
  
Standard pi word format
----
The second and third groups of bits are ignored if power â‰  2. If the most significant bits are set higher than 2, the device assumes the off state.
